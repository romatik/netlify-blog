My name is Mikhail Balyasin, but you can call me Misha. 
Currently I'm based in Berlin and working as a Data Scientist.
This blog is about things that interest me, namely:

1. R and everything around it.
2. Technology in higher education, especially MOOCs.
3. Data Science and how I apply it to everyday life.
4. Any combination of the above.

So if you are interested in any of this topics - feel free to stick around!
