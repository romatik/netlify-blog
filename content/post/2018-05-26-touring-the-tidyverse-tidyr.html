<p>This Thursday I’ve given a talk at Berlin R-Users Group. The topic was “Touring the tidyverse: tidy data + tidyr”. The idea is that this will become a series of talks where each consequent talk is going to present one (or couple) of packages from the tidyverse.</p>
<p>tidyr to me seems like a good choice for the first talk since concept of tidy data is so central to all of the packages. Therefore, understanding this concept makes it easier to work in tidyverse. The code for the talk and presentation itself are available at my github - <a href="https://github.com/romatik/touring_the_tidyverse" class="uri">https://github.com/romatik/touring_the_tidyverse</a>.</p>
<p>Slides are also here if you don’t want to go to github (process of embeding is described <a href="https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/09/06/adding-r-markdown-documents-of-other-output-formats/">here</a>):</p>
