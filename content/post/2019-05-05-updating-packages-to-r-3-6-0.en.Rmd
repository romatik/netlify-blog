R has recently updated to 3.6.0 and as you may or may not know it means that all packages with compiled parts (i.e., packages with C or C++) in them must be re-installed in order to be used. Some of the packages you had in 3.5.x might still work, but it's always a good idea to update them as well.

So today, when R has updated itself through Linux magic, I found myself re-installing packages by hand. After typing `install.packages` way too many times, I've finally thought to myself: "This is ridicolous, why don't I automate this". 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png")
```

But at least in this case it was more like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png")
```

That is all to say, that here is a small script that you can use to do the same thing, but much faster than me. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# this makes it easier, so why not install these 
# packages anyways upfront
install.packages(c("magrittr", "fs", "purrr", "stringr"))

# this is a path for your 3.5 library. 
# You can also use `libPaths()` to see where its at.
path <- "/path/to/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5/"

library(magrittr)

installed_before <- fs::dir_ls(path = path) %>% 
  purrr::map_chr(~stringr::str_remove(.x, path)) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  unname() 

installed_already <- as.data.frame(installed.packages()) %>% 
  `[[`("Package") %>% 
  as.character()

to_install <- setdiff(installed_before, installed_already)

install.packages(to_install)

non_cran_packages <- as.data.frame(installed.packages()) %>% 
  `[[`("Package") %>% 
  as.character() %>%
  {setdiff(installed_before, .)}
```

The script will leave you with the `non_cran_packages` character vector that you need to install by hand since there is no canonical place to look for them.
