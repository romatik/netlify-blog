<p>In the penultimate stop in “Touring the tidyverse” series of talks I was talking about <code>tidymodels</code>. It is a collection of packages that are built using tidy approach to make model fitting in R more predictable and extendable. The main force behind <code>tidymodels</code>-suite is Max Kuhn who you might know as an author and maintainer of <code>caret</code> package.</p>
<p><code>tidymodels</code> collection of packages is by far the least developed part of the <code>tidyverse</code> and it is under very active development at the moment. Nevertheless, even at this state the suite of packages is already usable and useful for certain use-cases. I’ve shown this in the talk using materials from 2-day “Applied Machine Learning” workshop that happened at rconf::2019 and was led by Max Kuhn himself. Specifically, materials that I’ve used come from parts 1-3 of the workshop with few additions. The most visible one is that I’ve added <code>package::</code> to every function call used. Hopefully, this makes it a bit clearer where each of the packages “lives” inside of <code>tidymodels</code> framework.</p>
